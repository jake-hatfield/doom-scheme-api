# Doom Scheme API

This is the API powering the composition completion feature in the [Doom Scheme app](httsp://github.com/jake-hatfield/doom-scheme). It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 Davinci model to complete a user-provided rap.

The prompt specifies that the generated text use foundational concepts in rap like consonance, assonance, onomatopoeia, metaphors, etc.

The API is built with:

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
